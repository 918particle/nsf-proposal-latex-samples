abstract = {{A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux.}},

abstract = { In a class of piecewise-constant image segmentation models, we propose to incorporate a weighted difference of anisotropic and isotropic total variation (AITV) to regularize the partition boundaries in an image. In particular, we replace the total variation regularization in the Chan--Vese segmentation model and a fuzzy region competition model by the proposed AITV. To deal with the nonconvex nature of AITV, we apply the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), in which the subproblems can be minimized by the primal-dual hybrid gradient method with linesearch. The convergence of the DCA scheme is analyzed. In addition, a generalization to color image segmentation is discussed. In the numerical experiments, we compare the proposed models with the classic convex approaches and the two-stage segmentation methods (smoothing and then thresholding) on various images, showing that our models are effective in image segmentation and robust with respect to impulsive noises. }

abstract = {Face tracking is an important computer vision technology that has been widely adopted in many areas, from cell phone applications to industry robots. In this paper, we introduce a novel way to parallelize a face contour detecting application based on the color-entropy preprocessed Chan–Vese model utilizing a total variation G-norm. This particular application is a complicated and unsupervised computational method requiring a large amount of calculations. Several core parts therein are difficult to parallelize due to heavily correlated data processing among iterations and pixels. We develop a novel approach to parallelize the data-dependent core parts and significantly improve the runtime performance of the model computation. We implement the parallelized program on OpenCL for both multi-core CPU and GPU. For 640 * 480 input images, the parallelized program on a NVidia GTX970 GPU, a NVidia GTX660 GPU, and an AMD FX8530 8-core CPU is on average 18.6, 12.0 and 4.40 times faster than its single-thread C version on the AMD FX8530 CPU, respectively. Some parallelized routines have much higher performance improvement compared to the whole program. For instance, on the NVidia GTX970 GPU, the parallelized entropy filter routine is on average 74.0 times faster than its single-thread C version on the AMD FX8530 8-core CPU. We discuss the parallelization methodologies in detail, including the scalability, thread models, as well as synchronization methods for both multi-core CPU and GPU.}

abstract = {Owing to their small interaction cross-section, neutrinos are unparalleled astronomical tracers. Ultra-high energy (UHE; E >  10 PeV) neutrinos probe the most distant, most explosive sources in the Universe, often obscured to optical telescopes. Radio-frequency (RF) detection of Askaryan radiation in cold polar ice is currently regarded as the best experimental measurement technique for UHE neutrinos, provided the RF properties of the ice target can be well-understood. To that end, the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment at the South Pole has used long-baseline RF propagation to extract information on the index-of-refraction (n=ϵr) in South Polar ice. Owing to the increasing ice density over the upper 150–200 m, rays are measured along two, nearly parallel paths, one of which refracts through an inflection point, with differences in both arrival time and arrival angle that can be used to constrain the neutrino properties. We also observe (first) indications for RF ice birefringence for signals propagating along predominantly horizontal trajectories, corresponding to an asymmetry of order 0.1% between the ordinary and extra-ordinary birefringent axes, numerically compatible with previous measurements of birefringent asymmetries for vertically-propagating radio-frequency signals at South Pole. Qualitatively, these effects offer the possibility of redundantly measuring the range from receiver to a neutrino interaction in Antarctic ice, if receiver antennas are deployed at shallow (z ∼  −25 m) depths. Such range information is essential in determining both the neutrino energy, as well as the incident neutrino direction.}

Information Field Theory offers a robust approach to this challenge by using Bayesian inference to calculate the most likely radio signal, given the recorded data.

The theory of a transmit-receive antenna system based on time-dependent effective height operator is summarized and applied to fully characterize the measurement antenna system and to reconstruct the electric field induced via the Askaryan process. The observed radiation intensity and phase as functions of frequency were found to agree with expectations from 0.75–11.5 GHz within experimental errors on the normalized electric field magnitude and the relative phase; σR|E|=0.039 μV/MHz/TeV and σϕ=17°. This is the first time this agreement has been observed over such a broad bandwidth, and the first measurement of the relative phase variation of an Askaryan pulse.

The neutrino production rate can be constrained through the accompanying electrons, positrons and gamma-rays that quickly cascade on the CMB and intergalactic magnetic fields to lower energies and generate a γ-ray background in the GeV–TeV region. Bethe–Heitler pair production by protons also contributes to the cascade and can tighten the neutrino constraints in models where extragalactic cosmic rays begin to dominate over the galactic component at a relatively low “crossover” energy. We investigate this issue in the light of the recent Fermi-LAT measurements of the diffuse extragalactic γ-ray background and illustrate by a fit to the HiRes spectrum how the prediction of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in all-proton models varies with the crossover energy. The neutrino flux is required to be smaller when the gamma-ray bound is applied, nevertheless such models are still consistent with HiRes and Fermi-LAT if one properly takes into account the energy uncertainty of cosmic ray measurements. The presently allowed flux is within reach of the IceCube neutrino telescope and other dedicated radio experiments.}},

In this paper, we present constraints on the diffuse flux of ultrahigh energy neutrinos between 1016 and 1021 eV resulting from a search for neutrinos in two complementary analyses, both analyzing four years of data (2013–2016) from the two deep stations (A2, A3) operating at that time. We place a 90\% CL upper limit on the diffuse all flavor neutrino flux at 1018 eV of EF(E)=5.6×10-16 cm-2 s-1 sr-1. This analysis includes four times the exposure of the previous ARA result and represents approximately 1/5th the exposure expected from operating ARA until the end of 2022.}},

abstract = {{Traditional ground-penetrating radar (GPR) systems typically use a single transceiver antenna unit, which is challenging to achieve high-fidelity, ultra-narrow pulse transmission. It leads to problems such as limited detection resolution and insufficient data acquisition. This paper proposes a multi-polarization GPR array that uses multiple antenna elements to work synergistically. An electromagnetic field solving algorithm that enables parallel computation is introduced the time-domain finite element method of dual-field decomposition to achieve efficient and wideband simulation of the electromagnetic characteristics of large arrays. Each antenna element of the array system is treated as a subdomain during the solution process, and the electric and magnetic field values for each subdomain are calculated separately. Adjacent antenna elements are explicitly connected by equivalent surface currents on the interface of the subdomains. Through the method, numerically simulates the antenna array, establishes the spatial multi-polarization input signal, and analyzes the polarization response of the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) electromagnetic signal under the antenna array structure to the target body. The research results demonstrate that under the ground-penetrating radar array observation mode, the target's multi-polarization signal information can accurately and effectively reflect it's corresponding position and morphological relationship. The multi-polarized input signal can better compress the width of the wavelet and improve the range resolution of the target body. AAt the same time, the antenna array excites pulse signals with the same center frequency to be superimposed in the equivalent amplitude and same phase on space. The formed plane beam signal increases the radiation energy, improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the data, and eliminates the flicker caused by the radar cross-section changing with the observation angle, and weakens the influence of the discontinuity of the profile data in the horizontal direction caused by the antenna's unstable pattern and strengthens the data quality.}},

We report here on measurements and a simulation of thermal noise correlations between nearby antennas, beamforming of impulsive signals, and a measurement of the expected improvement in trigger efficiency through the phased array technique.

abstract = {The detection of high energy neutrinos (1015–1020 eV) is an important step toward understanding the most energetic cosmic accelerators and would enable tests of fundamental physics at energy scales that cannot easily be achieved on Earth. In this energy range, there are two expected populations of neutrinos: the astrophysical flux observed with IceCube at lower energies (∼1 PeV) and the predicted cosmogenic flux at higher energies (∼1018 eV) . Radio detector arrays such as RICE, ANITA, ARA, and ARIANNA exploit the Askaryan effect and the radio transparency of glacial ice, which together enable enormous volumes of ice to be monitored with sparse instrumentation. We describe here the design for a phased radio array that would lower the energy threshold of radio techniques to the PeV scale, allowing measurement of the astrophysical flux observed with IceCube over an extended energy range. Meaningful energy overlap with optical Cherenkov telescopes could be used for energy calibration. The phased radio array design would also provide more efficient coverage of the large effective volume required to discover cosmogenic neutrinos.}

The resistivity of traces printed from conductive thermoplastic filaments made with carbon-black, graphene, and copper as conductive fillers was found to be 12, 0.78, and 0.014Ωcm, respectively, enabling the creation of resistors with values spanning 3 orders of magnitude. The carbon black and graphene filaments were brittle and fractured easily, but the copper-based filament could be bent at least 500 times with little change in its resistance. Impedance measurements made on the thermoplastic filaments demonstrate that the copper-based filament had an impedance similar to a copper PCB trace at frequencies greater than 1MHz. Dual material 3D printing was used to fabricate a variety of inductors and capacitors with properties that could be predictably tuned by modifying either the geometry of the components, or the materials used to fabricate the components. These resistors, capacitors, and inductors were combined to create a fully 3D printed high-pass filter with properties comparable to its conventional counterparts. The relatively low impedance of the copper-based filament enabled its use for 3D printing of a receiver coil for wireless power transfer. We also demonstrate the ability to embed and connect surface mounted components in 3D printed objects with a low-cost (\$1000 in parts), open source dual-material 3D printer. This work thus demonstrates the potential for FFF 3D printing to create complex, three-dimensional circuits composed of either embedded or fully-printed electronic components.}},

  abstract = {The ARIANNA hexagonal radio array (HRA) is an experiment in its pilot phase designed to detect cosmogenic neutrinos of energies above 10^16 eV. The most neutrino-like background stems from the radio emission of air showers. This article reports on dedicated efforts of simulating and detecting the signals of cosmic rays. A description of the fully radio self-triggered data-set, the properties of the detected air shower signals in the frequency range of \unit[100-500]{MHz} and the consequences for neutrino detection are given. 38 air shower signals are identified by their distinct waveform characteristics, are in good agreement with simulations and their signals provide evidence that neutrino-induced radio signals will be distinguishable with high efficiency in ARIANNA. The cosmic ray flux at a mean energy of $6.5^{+1.2}_{-1.0}\times10^{17}$ eV is measured to be $1.1^{+1.0}_{-0.7}\times10^{-16}$ eV$^{-1}$km$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$yr$^{-1}$ and one five-fold coincident event is used to illustrate the capabilities of the ARIANNA detector to reconstruct arrival direction and energy of air showers.}

  abstract = {Neutrinos are key to probing the deep structure of matter and the high-energy Universe. Yet, until recently, their interactions had only been measured at laboratory energies up to about 350 GeV. An opportunity to measure their interactions at higher energies opened up with the detection of high-energy neutrinos in IceCube, partially of astrophysical origin. Scattering off matter inside the Earth affects the distribution of their arrival directions --- from this, we extract the neutrino-nucleon cross section at energies from 18 TeV to 2 PeV, in four energy bins, in spite of uncertainties in the neutrino flux. Using six years of public IceCube High-Energy Starting Events, we explicitly show for the first time that the energy dependence of the cross section above 18 TeV agrees with the predicted softer-than-linear dependence, and reaffirm the absence of new physics that would make the cross section rise sharply, up to a center-of-mass energy of ~1 TeV.},

We also present the associated uncertainties propagated from the PDFs, as well as parametrizations of the cross section central values, their uncertainty bounds, and the inelasticity distributions for ease of use in Monte Carlo simulations. For the latter we only provide parametrizations for energies above 107 GeV. Finally, we assess the feasibility of future neutrino experiments to constrain the νN cross section in the ultrahigh energy regime using a technique that is independent of the flux spectrum of incident neutrinos. A significant deviation from the predicted standard model cross sections could be an indication of new physics, such as extra space-time dimensions, and we present expected constraints on such models as a function of the number of events observed in a future subterranean neutrino detector.}

From these 20 sources, we analyze the apparent speeds of 43 jet components that are all detected at four or more epochs. As has been found for other TeV HBLs, the apparent speeds of these components are relatively slow. About two-thirds of the components have an apparent speed that is consistent (within two-sigma) with no motion; and some of these components may be stationary patterns whose apparent speed does not relate to the underlying bulk flow speed. In addition, a superluminal tail to the apparent speed distribution of the TeV HBLs is detected for the first time, with eight components in seven sources having a two-sigma lower limit on the apparent speed exceeding 1c. We combine the data from these 20 sources with an additional 18 sources from the literature to analyze the complete apparent speed distribution of all 38 TeV HBLs that have been studied with VLBI at multiple epochs. The highest two-sigma apparent speed lower limit considering all sources is 3.6c. This suggests that bulk Lorentz factors of up to about 4, but probably not much higher, exist in the parsec-scale radio emitting regions of these sources, consistent with estimates obtained in the radio by other means such as brightness temperatures. This can be reconciled with the high Lorentz factors estimated from the high-energy data if the jet has velocity structures consisting of different emission regions with different Lorentz factors. In particular, we analyze the current apparent speed data for the TeV HBLs in the context of a model with a fast central spine and a slower outer layer.}

ABSTRACT = {Phased array radar systems have a wide variety of applications in engineering and physics research. Phased array design usually requires numerical modeling with expensive commercial computational packages. Using the open-source MIT Electrogmagnetic Equation Propagation (MEEP) package, a set of phased array designs is presented. Specifically, one and two-dimensional arrays of Yagi-Uda and horn antennas were modeled in the bandwidth [0.1–5] GHz, and compared to theoretical expectations in the far-field. Precise matches between MEEP simulation and radiation pattern predictions at different frequencies and beam angles are demonstrated. Given that the computations match the theory, the effect of embedding a phased array within a medium of varying index of refraction is then computed. Understanding the effect of varying index on phased arrays is critical for proposed ultra-high energy neutrino observatories which rely on phased array detectors embedded in natural ice. Future work will develop the phased array concepts with parallel MEEP, in order to increase the detail, complexity, and speed of the computations.},

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Evidence for an extraterrestrial flux of high-energy neutrinos has now been found in multiple searches with the IceCube detector. The first solid evidence was provided by a search for neutrino events with deposited energies  TeV and interaction vertices inside the instrumented volume. Recent analyses suggest that the extraterrestrial flux extends to lower energies and is also visible with throughgoing, νμ-induced tracks from the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we combine the results from six different IceCube searches for astrophysical neutrinos in a maximum-likelihood analysis. The combined event sample features high-statistics samples of shower-like and track-like events. The data are fit in up to three observables: energy, zenith angle, and event topology. Assuming the astrophysical neutrino flux to be isotropic and to consist of equal flavors at Earth, the all-flavor spectrum with neutrino energies between 25 TeV and 2.8 PeV is well described by an unbroken power law with best-fit spectral index −2.50 ± 0.09 and a flux at 100 TeV of . Under the same assumptions, an unbroken power law with index −2 is disfavored with a significance of 3.8σ (p = 0.0066%) with respect to the best fit. This significance is reduced to 2.1σ (p = 1.7%) if instead we compare the best fit to a spectrum with index −2 that has an exponential cut-off at high energies. Allowing the electron-neutrino flux to deviate from the other two flavors, we find a νe fraction of 0.18 ± 0.11 at Earth. The sole production of electron neutrinos, which would be characteristic of neutron-decay-dominated sources, is rejected with a significance of 3.6σ (p = 0.014%).}

These calculations, and the associated open-source code, allow the user to avoid computationally intensive Monte Carlo cascade simulations. Searches for cosmogenic neutrinos in Askaryan-based detectors benefit from computational speed, because scans of Askaryan parameter-space are required to match neutrino signals. The Askaryan field is derived from cascade equations verified with Geant4 simulations, and compared with prior numerical and semi-analytic calculations. Finally, instructive cases of the model are transformed from the Fourier domain to the time-domain. Next-generation in situ detectors like ARA and ARIANNA can use analytic time-domain signal models to search for correlations with event candidates.}},

This allows for a unique identification of neutrinos against backgrounds arriving from above. Furthermore, the time delay between the direct and reflected signal (D'n'R) correlates with the distance to the neutrino interaction vertex, a crucial quantity to determine the neutrino energy. In a simulation study, we derive the relation between time delay and distance and study the corresponding experimental uncertainties in estimating neutrino energies. We find that the resulting contribution to the energy resolution is well below the natural limit set by the unknown inelasticity in the initial neutrino interaction. We present an in-situ measurement that proves the experimental feasibility of this technique. Continuous monitoring of the local snow accumulation in the vicinity of the transmit and receive antennas using this technique provide a precision of \$\textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\$(1 mm) in surface elevation, which is much better than that needed to apply the D'n'R technique to neutrinos.}},

UHE neutrinos may provide important clues to understanding the nature of cosmic-ray sources. ARIANNA aims to detect UHE neutrinos via radio (Askaryan) emission from particle showers when a neutrino interacts with ice, which is an efficient method for neutrinos with energies between 10\textasciicircum16 eV and 10\textasciicircum20 eV. The ARIANNA radio detectors are located in Antarctic ice just beneath the surface. Neutrino observation requires that radio pulses propagate to the antennas at the surface with minimum distortion by the ice and firn medium. Using the residual hole from the South Pole Ice Core Project, radio pulses were emitted from a transmitter located up to 1.7 km below the snow surface. By measuring these signals with an ARIANNA surface station, the angular and polarization reconstruction abilities are quantified, which are required to measure the direction of the neutrino. After deconvolving the raw signals for the detector response and attenuation from propagation through the ice, the signal pulses show no significant distortion and agree with a reference measurement of the emitter made in an anechoic chamber. Furthermore, the signal pulses reveal no significant birefringence for our tested geometry of mostly vertical ice propagation. The origin of the transmitted radio pulse was measured with an angular resolution of 0.37 degrees indicating that the neutrino direction can be determined with good precision if the polarization of the radio-pulse can be well determined. In the present study we obtained a resolution of the polarization vector of 2.7 degrees. Neither measurement show a significant offset relative to expectation.}},

PE methods provide an approximate solution to Maxwell's equations, in contrast to full-field solutions such as finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) methods, yet provide a more complete model of propagation than simple geometric ray-tracing (RT) methods that are the current state of the art for simulating in-ice radio detection of neutrino-induced cascades. PE are more computationally efficient than FDTD methods, and more flexible than RT methods, allowing for the inclusion of diffractive effects, and modeling of propagation in regions that cannot be modeled with geometric methods. We present a new PE approximation suited to the in-ice case. We conclude that current ray-tracing methods may be too simplistic in their treatment of ice properties, and their continued use could overestimate experimental sensitivity for in-ice neutrino detection experiments. We discuss the implications for current in-ice Askaryan-type detectors and for the upcoming Radar Echo Telescope; two families of experiments for which these results are most relevant. We suggest that PE methods be investigated further for in-ice radio applications.}},

Undeniably, antenna design at all levels strongly relies on electromagnetic simulation software. However, despite the large number and the high quality of the available open-source simulation packages, most companies have no doubts about the choice of commercial program suites. At the same time, in the academic world, it is frequent to develop in-house simulation software, even from scratch and without proper knowledge of the existing possibilities. The rationale of the present paper is to review, from a practical viewpoint, the open-source software that can be useful in the antenna design process. To this end, an introductory overview of the usual design workflow is firstly presented. Subsequently, the strengths and weaknesses of open-source software compared to its commercial counterpart are analyzed. After that, the main open-source packages that are currently available online are briefly described. The last part of this paper is devoted to a preliminary numerical benchmark for the assessment of the capabilities and limitations of a subset of the presented open-source programs. The benchmark includes the calculation of some fundamental antenna parameters for four different typologies of radiating elements.}},

We find it is possible to decompose the calculated fields into the product of a form factor, characterizing a moving charge distribution, multiplying a general integral which depends on the charge evolution. In circumstances of interest for cosmic ray physics, the resulting expressions can be evaluated explicitly in terms of a few parameters obtainable from shower codes.

In the context of astroparticle physics experiments aimed at understanding radio emissions from cosmic rays interacting in the Earth's polar regions, our goals for this study were twofold: (1) identify radio frequency wave speed polarization asymmetries in Antarctica and (for the first time) in Greenland and (2) directly extract the depth dependence of the radio frequency field attenuation length as well as map out the attenuation over a large area. We first examine asymmetries in the real part of the permittivity (index‐of‐refraction ) using Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets bedrock radar reflection data taken from a single location, but with different signal polarizations. These data indicate birefringence for flow parallel‐, versus perpendicular‐to the local ice‐flow direction, with the former corresponding to smaller index‐of‐refraction (i.e., faster wave speed). Second, we have investigated the imaginary part of the permittivity ( ) and extracted the depth dependence of the field attenuation length ( ), as well as estimated the depth‐averaged radio frequency attenuation length from data taken near the Greenland Ice Core Project site near Summit, Greenland. We obtain m based on calculated values in the 1000–2000 m ice depth interval to which we have sensitivity and extrapolated to the full depth, where the errors shown reflect our uncertainty in our extrapolation. We also observe the expected decrease in attenuation length with increasing depth/temperature. A depth‐averaged attenuation length is also extracted directly from the relative strengths of the observed bedrock versus surface returns over large regions of both Greenland and Antarctica. Apparent radio frequency birefringent asymmetry is observed in polar ice CReSIS data can possibly be used to estimate depth‐dependent attenuation of polar ice near GRIP The expanse of the CReSIS data set might be used to generalize points \#1 and \#2 to other polar ice}},

We present results from two searches targeting emission coincident with the sky localization of each gravitational wave event within a 1000 second time window centered around the reported merger time. One search uses a model-independent unbinned maximum likelihood analysis, which uses neutrino data from IceCube to search for point-like neutrino sources consistent with the sky localization of GW events. The other uses the Low-Latency Algorithm for Multi-messenger Astrophysics, which incorporates astrophysical priors through a Bayesian framework and includes LIGO-Virgo detector characteristics to determine the association between the GW source and the neutrinos. No significant neutrino coincidence is seen by either search during the first two observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo detectors. We set upper limits on the time-integrated neutrino emission within the 1000 second window for each of the 11 GW events. These limits range from 0.02-0.7 \$\textbackslashmathrm\{GeV\textbackslashtextasciitildecm\textasciicircum\{-2\}\}\$. We also set limits on the total isotropic equivalent energy, \$E\_\{\textbackslashmathrm\{iso\}\}\$, emitted in high-energy neutrinos by each GW event.

However, the miniaturization, ultra-wideband and high gain often restrict each other in the antenna design. In this paper, a dual-polarized, double-slot, antipodal tapered slot antenna with a double-layer, dual-loop structure and novel slot edges is presented. The proposed magnetic dual-loop structure has the capacity to reduce the low cut-off frequency of the double-slot tapered slot antenna by weakening the resonance and coupling. In addition, the high gain, low sidelobe level (SLL), and low cross-polarization level are achieved in the boresight direction. A novel gradient slot profile is designed to improve the low-frequency directivity of the tapered slot antenna without affecting the matching. To feed the antenna elements, a kind of wideband, balun-divider structure is designed. The dual-polarized antenna is combined by two orthogonal elements in a cross configuration without galvanic contact or influence to performance. The measured results show that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna is 0.6\textbackslashtextasciitilde4 GHz, and the maximum gain is 11 dBi. The isolation between the two antenna ports is better than 32 dB, and the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) is better than 20 dB.}},
